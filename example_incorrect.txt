1. **Critical Thinking (10):** This involves analyzing the provided SVG path command to understand what shape it draws. You would need to evaluate the commands (MoveTo `M`, LineTo `L`) and their coordinates to deduce the shape formed by connecting these points.

2. **Simplification (4):** Simplifying the problem by breaking down the SVG path command into segments (each `M` and `L` command) can make it easier to visualize and understand the shape being drawn.

3. **Visualization (Create your own reasoning module):** Since the task involves understanding a visual representation from a textual command, a reasoning module focused on visualization would be helpful. This involves mentally or physically sketching the path described by the commands to identify the shape.

4. **Analytical Reasoning (29):** This task requires analyzing the given data (path commands and their coordinates) to understand the structure and form of the shape. It involves recognizing patterns and relationships between the points described in the path.

5. **Geometry Knowledge (Create your own reasoning module):** Understanding basic geometric shapes and their properties can help in identifying the shape from the given path. This module involves applying knowledge of geometry to the problem.

These modules together facilitate a comprehensive approach to solving the task by enabling critical examination of the SVG path, simplification of the problem, visualization of the shape, analytical reasoning to connect the dots, and applying geometric knowledge to identify the shape correctly.'}}




Current state: {'adapt': {'adapted_modules': "To effectively solve the task of identifying the shape drawn by the SVG path element, we refine and specify the roles of the following reasoning modules:

1. **Path Command Analysis (Critical Thinking):** This module focuses on a detailed examination of the SVG path commands provided (`M` for MoveTo, `L` for LineTo), and the coordinates that accompany these commands. The goal is to dissect the sequence of movements and lines to infer the shape they collectively outline. By critically analyzing each command and its directional endpoint, one can deduce the overall structure that emerges from these connected points.

2. **Command Segmentation (Simplification):** This approach involves deconstructing the SVG path command into its individual components, isolating each `M` and `L` command along with their respective coordinates. By segmenting the path into smaller, more manageable pieces, the task of visualizing and understanding the resultant shape becomes significantly less daunting. This step acts as a precursor to effective visualization by providing a clearer, simplified view of the path's structure.

3. **Path Visualization (Visualization):** Given the abstract nature of SVG path commands, this module emphasizes the importance of translating textual commands into a visual format. Whether through mental imaging or drawing out the path, this process aims to create a visual representation of the shape described by the SVG commands. Visualization serves as a critical bridge between abstract commands and tangible geometric understanding.

4. **Coordinate Pattern Analysis (Analytical Reasoning):** This module extends beyond basic analysis to examine the relationships and patterns among the coordinates specified in the path commands. By scrutinizing how the points connect and the angles they form, one can identify recurring geometric properties or anomalies within the shape. Analytical reasoning facilitates the recognition of patterns that signify specific geometric figures.

5. **Geometric Identification (Geometry Knowledge):** Armed with an understanding of geometric principles and shape properties, this module applies theoretical geometry to the practical task at hand. By comparing the visualized shape and analyzed patterns to known geometric figures, one can classify the shape according to its geometric identity. This involves recognizing key characteristics such as the number of sides, symmetry, and angle properties that align with specific geometric shapes.

By refining these modules, we equip ourselves with a structured and focused approach to identifying the shape depicted by the SVG path element. Each module plays a critical role in dissecting, visualizing, and ultimately determining the geometric figure represented by the given path commands."}}
